# StudentCourseManager
A desktop JavaFX application to see a course and the relationships between its subjects.

Made with Java 17 and Java FX 8, using Maven Repositories.

By performing

mvn clean

mvn install

on a local terminal in the code's folder, the application will produce a shaded jar that has all the libraries bundled in it.

This allows for using packaging tools such as launch4j (https://launch4j.sourceforge.net) to generate an .exe file in Windows that is portable.

All is needed to run such .exe is a JRE 17 and the javapath set.
